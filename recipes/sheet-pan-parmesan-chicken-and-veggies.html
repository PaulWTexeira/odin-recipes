        <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>

        <ol>
            
            <br>
            
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
                Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
            
            <br>
           
            <br>
            
            <li>Combine oregano, parsley, paprika, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper in a small bowl.</li>
            
            <br>
            
            <br>
            
            <li>Place green beans, potato, bell pepper, broccoli, and garlic onto the prepared sheet pan. 
                Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with 1/2 of the seasoning mix; toss to coat.</li>
            
            <br>
            
            <br>
            
            <li>Place flour into a bowl. 
                Place melted butter into a second bowl. 
                Mix panko, 2/3 cup Parmesan cheese, and the remaining seasoning mix together in a third bowl.</li>
            
            <br>
            
            <br>
            
            <li>Slice chicken into 1 1/4-inch strips, then coat in flour. 
                Dredge floured strips in melted butter, dripping excess butter back into the bowl. 
                Press into Parmesan-panko mixture until heavily coated on both sides.</li>
            
            <br>
            
            <br>
            
            <li>Push veggies to one half of the sheet pan. 
                Place coated chicken strips onto the other side. 
                Sprinkle any remaining Parmesan-panko mixture over chicken, pressing to adhere.</li>
            
            <br>
            
            <br>
            
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. 
                Flip chicken strips and stir veggies, then continue to bake until chicken juices run clear and veggies are crisp-tender, 10 to 15 more minutes. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            
            <br>
            
            <br>
            
            <li>Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce: Whisk mayonnaise, ketchup, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce together in a small bowl.</li>
            
            <br>
            
            <br>
            
            <li>Remove chicken and veggies from the oven. 
                Toss veggies with remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. 
                Serve with dipping sauce.</li>
        
        </ol>
